# LAMMPS Tutorials

This repository contains a collection of **tutorial materials, example scripts, and visualization tools**
for learning and teaching **molecular dynamics simulations using LAMMPS**.

The content is designed to help students and beginners understand both the **physical concepts**
and the **practical implementation** of simulations, with a focus on clarity, reproducibility,
and conceptual correctness.

---

## Contents

The repository includes tutorials and examples on:

- Lennard–Jones fluids
- Green–Kubo calculation of viscosity
- Unit conversion from LJ to SI units
- Brownian and Langevin dynamics
- Overdamped vs underdamped motion
- Colloids in solvent (multiscale visualization)
- Carbon nanotube (CNT) topology construction
- Verification of bonds, angles, dihedrals, and impropers
- Python-based post-processing and visualization
- Density–temperature phase diagrams and binodals

Each tutorial typically contains:
- LAMMPS input files
- Python analysis or visualization scripts
- Figures suitable for lectures or reports
- Explanatory notes for students

---

## Intended Audience

- Undergraduate and graduate students in physics, chemistry, and materials science
- Beginners learning molecular dynamics
- Researchers who want reference implementations
- Instructors preparing tutorial sessions or lab courses

---
